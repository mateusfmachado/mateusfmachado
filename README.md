- 👋 Hi, I'm @mateusfmachado. I work as an eCommerce developer helping online stores increase their conversion rate.

- 🛍 I've worked with stores using platforms such as Shopify, Vtex, and Tray. (see more on [amplieecro.com.br](https://amplieecro.com.br)) 

- 📚 I'm a CXL alumnus (CRO minidegree) and have experience with AB testing and Web Analytics 🚀

- 👀 I'm interested in eCommerce, AI tools, and the stock market. I love to create new things and share what I have learned.

- 🌱 Building with Shopify is incredible! I'm learning more about Shopify Apps, Hydrogen, and its endless possibilities. 

- 🔍 Looking to work with more merchants and agencies that use the Shopify Ecosystem. If you have a store or agency, contact me! I would love to know more about your work and how I can contribute.

- 📫 You can contact me by email: mateus@amplieecro.com.br
